Version: 0.1.0
Author: Daniel Woodrich
Maintainer: Daniel Woodrich daniel.woodrich@noaa.gov
Description: This package contains functions will allow for SQL access (queries)
    and DML (insert, update, and delete data). There are other convenience functions
    which depend on other environments, such as locally or on NAS acoustic data files 
    with standard formatting. Using this package for DML is encouraged, since it will
    encourages entrypoints into the most commonly modified data tables (generally, 
    detections, filegroups, and accessory data). These functions are not comprehensive, 
    as a majority of the SQL/DML capabilities are provided under the basic R DBI.
